# AutoPoint
An optical flow assisted point annotation tool for creating point tracking datasets. This is based on the 
tool used to create the [TAP-Vid](https://tapvid.github.io/) dataset. Specifically the Juypter Notebook [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/tapnet/blob/main/colabs/optical_flow_track_assist.ipynb)

Still in development...
